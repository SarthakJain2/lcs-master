# LCS

Checkout `Camelot-saved` for the working node thingy we used before.
We are eternally grateful, Carlin.

## What is LCS?!

The ludicrous card system is a system where
applications offer "cards" so that users
can see everything in the same page.

This is the main authentication system.
It handles a bunch.
The hope is to deploy this as a bunch of AWS
Lambdas.

## How Ludicrous?

We ran a few hackathons off it so, pretty ludicrous.

## Why LCS?

See the very salty rant on [the history of LCS](https://github.com/HackRU/lcs/wiki/History) for more.

Basically, because Heman didn't understand a codebase, he made one that the next generation won't understand.
He's tried very hard [to help with understanding](https://github.com/HackRU/lcs/wiki), but time will tell if it worked.

## How to Install LCS?

See [the deployment instructions](https://github.com/HackRU/lcs/wiki/Deploying) for too much information.

Basically, you set up AWS lambdas, an AWS API gateway API, and then a few third party APIs.
Oh yeah, and a DB... somewhere.

## Where is LCS Used?

Like... everywhere. The one app, the web frontend, and a few other apps use LCS to some extent.

This is the user registration backend, so is indispensable to anything that interacts with the hackers at HackRU.

## How Should LCS Code Look?

See [#20](#20) : I don't know yet.

## What's Next for LCS?

In order of decreasing priority:
1. [ ] Check the read endpoint for security issues. ([#22](#22))
1. [ ] Ensure that magiclink comsumption is sensible.
1. [x] Add continuous integration, testing, and jazz. ([#20](#20))

Issues not referenced here are not thought of as a priority (so get to them if you have time).

## More on LCS?

[Ja, ein Wiki](https://github.com/HackRU/lcs/wiki). [How'd you like 'em apples?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcZPWkNY6x8 "Will Hunting and I are both being pricks.")
